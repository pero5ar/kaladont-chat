# kaladont-chat

A spin-off on the soicket.io getting started chat tutorial (https://socket.io/get-started/chat).

The app uses the same functionalities presented in the tutorial, with added logic for the Kaladont game, and the client is built with React.

Kaladont is a simple children's game in Croatia.

The way it's played is that Player A says a word (e.g. "chat"), after which player B must respond with a word that begins with the last two letters of the previous word (e.g. "**at**om"), player C then responds following the same rules (e.g. "**om**en").
The winner is the player that first says a word that ends with "nt" (like "kalado**nt**").

Obviously this game is ment to be played in Croatian.
